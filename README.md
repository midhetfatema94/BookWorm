# BookWorm

It is a ``CoreData`` based application to store a reading list of the user and rate the books read according to the user's experience. 

**Features are:**
* Combining CoreData with SwiftUI
* ``@Binding`` & ``@FetchRequest`` property wrappers
* ``AnyView`` type erasure
* Sorting with ``NSSortDescriptor`` and deleting from CoreData
* Using ``.constant`` for making binding properties read-only
